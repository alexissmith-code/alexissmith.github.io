      In this software engineering course our final project was to implement a random coin flip simulator where you could place bets, login, and kept a leaderboard using SQL queries.
      Me and my partner:
      -Planned project and altered throughout process using Flowcharts like Class diagrams.
      -Implemented random number generation to simulate coin flips and dice rolls.
      -Ability to create and login to account using SQL
      -Kept track of score using SQL and created leaderboard
      -Allowed ability to bet on coin flip and dice roll
      -Practiced debugging and testing to ensure reliability.

    <h2 class="home">Budget App</h2>
    <p>
      For this project I used Android Studio to create an app where users can add their expenses and budgets. Users can add expenses by clicking the add expense item in the toolbar. When a new expense is added, it is saved in the database and displayed in the RecyclerView through a the expenses adapter. The Expense class manages the list of expenses as a mutable list. Users can click on any item in the RecyclerView to update or delete it. Expense names and amounts can be updated, and changes are reflected both in the database and the Recycler View. Deleting an expense removes it from the database and updates the Recycler View in real time as well. Clicking the other toolbar item allows the user to enter their paycheck amount and select a date using the Date Picker Fragment. After entering the information, users can click the "Add Paycheck" button to update the "Budget" TextView. A Toast message displays the paycheck date as confirmation and the media player is used to play a mp3 file. The app calculates the remaining budget by subtracting the total expenses from the paycheck amount. This calculation is performed in the background using the Work Manager, ensuring smooth performance and real-time updates via LiveData.<br>
